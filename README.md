# Amazon Reviews Sentiment Analysis Dataset


## Description
This repository contains the code that was used to scrape Amazon for their product reviews in the Electronics department.

The dataset is available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/laxman22/amazon-product-reviews-for-sentiment-analysis/data) and this repository can be used to extend the functionality of this dataset. Unit tests are also present in the ```unittests.py``` file.

In order to run this code successfully, you must have the dataset with the name ```ProductReviews.csv``` and create another empty file named ```links.csv``` in order for the scraper to keep track of the links traversed so the scraper can continue where it left off in case of any interruptions.
